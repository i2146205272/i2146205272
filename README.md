- 👋 Hi, I’m @i2146205272
- 👀 I’m interested in things and stuff
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about things
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on lots of stuff
- 📫 How to reach me ... my username has a really hard cifer that when solved gives you a special telepathic channel you can use to get ahold of me, please don't share the solution with anyone other than someone you might think may want to contact me about something, but only if it is not about to sell me something, invest in something, anything politcal, anything that is remotely tied to facebook, instagram or amazon... or is not fun and expressly nothing that is fully boring or robotic-dialed (oops I just gave away a hint to the cipher).
